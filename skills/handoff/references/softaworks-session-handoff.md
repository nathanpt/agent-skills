### Plugin packaging

The same skills ship to Claude Code and Cursor, but the two platforms package them **differently** — and the asymmetry is deliberate, not an oversight.

| Claude Code | Cursor |
| --- | --- |
| Plugins published | Two (`mittwald-migrate`, `mittwald-zerodeploy`) | One (`mittwald-agent-skills`) bundling both skills |
| Plugin root | Each skill directory | The repository root |
| Manifest | `skills//.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` |
| How skills are found | Claude accepts **a single `SKILL.md` at the plugin root** | Cursor only scans a `skills/` directory |

Cursor has no equivalent of Claude's root-`SKILL.md` fallback, so a per-skill Cursor plugin would need its own nested `skills//SKILL.md` — which would mean either duplicating every skill or moving them out of `skills/` and breaking `npx skills add`, the README links, and `validate-skills.sh`. Pointing one Cursor plugin at the repo root avoids all of that: the existing `skills/` layout *is* Cursor's documented default, so both skills are discovered with no files moved.

The trade-off: Cursor users install one plugin and get both skills; they can't take just one.

#### Bundled MCP server (Cursor)

`mcp.json` at the repository root is auto-discovered by Cursor and connects the mittwald MCP server on install. It exists so the Cursor plugin **replaces** the manual [MCP setup guide](https://developer.mittwald.de/docs/v2/agentic-integration/mcp/getting-connected/cursor/) rather than pointing at it — installing the plugin is the whole setup.

Two things about it are load-bearing; don't change them casually:

* **The server key must stay `mittwald`.** Cursor exposes MCP tools as `mcp____`, and both skills detect their preferred surface by probing for `mcp__mittwald__mittwald_*` (see `references/mittwald-surfaces.md`). Renaming the key silently drops every skill to its CLI/API fallback.
* **`url` alone — no `headers`, no `auth` block.** That is what triggers Cursor's OAuth 2.1 + PKCE flow, so no token is ever written to a file in this repo. This is **verified**, not assumed: on a real install Cursor reaches `statusType=needsAuth`, offers the authenticate action, and completes the flow. It works because `auth.mcp.mittwald.de` advertises a `registration_endpoint`, so Cursor registers itself via Dynamic Client Registration and needs no pre-issued client ID.

  Some Cursor plugins (e.g. the official Slack one) hardcode `auth: { CLIENT_ID: "…" }`. **We deliberately don't**, and don't need to — mittwald supports DCR, so there is no Cursor-specific OAuth client to register or keep in sync. mittwald also accepts a `"Authorization": "Bearer ${env:MITTWALD_API_TOKEN}"` header for headless/CI use, but hardcoding that here would force a token on interactive users and break the OAuth path when the env var is unset. Users who need it can add the header in their own `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.

Only Cursor gets the bundled server today. Claude Code plugins can ship MCP servers too (via `.mcp.json` or an `mcpServers` field), so the same treatment is possible there — it just hasn't been done yet.

### Design Principles

1. **SKILL.md is the entry point** - Keep it under 200 lines. It should be a workflow index, not a manual.
2. **Playbooks are executable** - Each playbook is a self-contained guide for one phase. The AI follows them step-by-step.
3. **References are background** - Context, explanations, and deep dives. The AI loads these on-demand when playbooks reference them.
4. **Separation of concerns** - Playbooks say "what to do", references explain "why and how".
5. **Agent-agnostic** - Pure markdown. No code, no agent-specific features. Works with any AI assistant.

---

## File Conventions

### SKILL.md

* **Purpose**: Workflow index and trigger matcher
* **Length**: < 200 lines
* **Structure**:

  ```
  # Skill Name Skill Name ## Triggers Triggers - ## Workflow Workflow - ## Playbooks Playbooks - - ## References References - -
  ```

### Playbooks

* **Purpose**: Step-by-step executable guides
* **Naming**: Descriptive, action-oriented (e.g., `migrate-mysql.md`, `cutover-dns.md`)
* **For zerodeploy**: Number-prefixed for sequence (e.g., `01-provision-target.md`)
* **Structure**:

  ```
  # Playbook Title Playbook Title ## Context Context - - - ## Steps Steps 1. 2. 3. ## Troubleshooting Troubleshooting - - ## Next Steps Next Steps - -
  ```

### References

* **Purpose**: Background knowledge, explanations, catalogs
* **Naming**: Descriptive noun (e.g., `pitfalls.md`, `ssh-modes.md`)
* **Structure**: Flexible - whatever works for the content. Can be:
  + Catalog (e.g., app catalog, database engines)
  + Concept explanation (e.g., SSH modes, Railpack overview)
  + Troubleshooting guide (e.g., pitfalls)
  + Decision tree (e.g., when to escalate)

## Adding New Content

### Adding a Playbook

1. Create the playbook file in `skills//playbooks/`
2. Follow the playbook structure above
3. Add an entry to `SKILL.md` under the appropriate workflow phase
4. Test with an AI assistant - does it execute correctly?

### Adding a Reference

1. Create the reference file in `skills//references/`
2. Write comprehensive, clear content
3. Add an entry to `SKILL.md` references section
4. Link from relevant playbooks
5. Test - is the AI able to find and use this reference when needed?

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills//` directory
2. Create `SKILL.md` with triggers and workflow (frontmatter `name:` must match the directory)
3. Create `playbooks/` and `references/` subdirectories
4. Populate with content following conventions above
5. Add section to main `README.md`
6. Add symlink instructions to `README.md`
7. Publish it to both plugin systems (see [Plugin packaging](#plugin-packaging)):
   * **Claude Code**: add `skills//.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and append an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
   * **Cursor**: nothing to do — the root plugin discovers any new `skills/*/SKILL.md` automatically. Cursor admins must re-import the repository URL to pick it up, though; auto-refresh does not surface newly added plugins.
8. Test installation and triggering

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Install locally**:

   ```
   ~$(pwd)$() ~$(pwd)$() ~
   ```
2. **Restart your AI assistant** (VS Code, Claude Code, etc.)
3. **Test trigger phrases**:

   * "I want to migrate to mittwald"
   * "Help me deploy my app to mittwald"
4. **Walk through a workflow**:

   * Does the AI load the correct playbook?
   * Does it follow the steps?
   * Does it reference the right background docs?
5. **Test error scenarios**:

   * Missing prerequisites
   * API errors
   * Network issues

### Testing the Cursor plugin locally

Cursor installs a plugin from a **git commit, not from your working directory** — even when the marketplace source is a local path. At import it resolves the repo to a commit SHA, pins it in its backend marketplace record, and clones *that commit* into `~/.cursor/plugins/cache////`.

Consequences, in the order they will bite you:

1. **Uncommitted or branch-only changes are invisible.** Commit before importing, and import from the branch you want to test.
2. **The pin does not follow your branch.** Merging into `master` afterwards changes nothing; Cursor keeps loading the pinned SHA. Reloading the window and disabling/re-enabling the plugin don't clear it either.
3. **To re-pin, remove the whole marketplace** in Dashboard → Plugins and re-add it, so the SHA is resolved again.

The confusing part is that the plugin *listing* is read live from your repo while its *contents* come from the pinned clone. A component you just added shows up in the UI but does nothing — which looks exactly like a broken component rather than a stale checkout.

Verify what Cursor actually loaded before debugging anything else:

```
# What commit is pinned, and does that checkout contain what you expect? # ~# Did the MCP server get a client? Look for statusType=needsAuth, then connected. # ~ \ *** |# Which commit/source Cursor resolved (macOS path): # "mittwald" " " ~ \ ** \ * |
```

No `plugin-mittwald-agent-skills-mittwald` client in those logs means the server was never loaded — check the pinned commit first. It does **not** mean OAuth failed.

### Testing with Different AI Assistants

Test with multiple assistants to ensure compatibility:

* VS Code Copilot
* Claude Code
* OpenAI Codex (via AGENTS.md)

Each should be able to load and execute the skills without modification.

## Continuous Integration

Because this repository is pure markdown, CI focuses on content integrity rather than builds or unit tests. Three checks run on every pull request (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. **Markdown lint** — `markdownlint-cli2` enforces consistent, clean-rendering markdown. Rules are configured in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`.
2. **Internal link check** — `lychee --offline` verifies that every relative link (playbook → reference, README → skill, etc.) points to a file that exists.
3. **SKILL.md validation** — `scripts/validate-skills.sh` checks that each `skills/*/SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter, that its `name:` matches the directory, and that it stays under 200 lines.

External URLs are **not** checked on PRs (third-party hosts go down or rate-limit, which would cause flaky failures). Instead, `.github/workflows/external-links.yml` checks them on a weekly schedule and opens a tracking issue if any are broken.

### Running the checks locally (before every commit)

Run these from the repository root and make sure all three pass before committing. A green local run means a green PR.

```
# 1. Markdown: auto-fix mechanical issues, then verify the result is clean. #"**/*.md" " " # rewrites files in place #"**/*.md" " " # must report 0 errors ## 2. Internal links resolve (requires lychee: https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee, ## or run via Docker: docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/input" -w /input lycheeverse/lychee ...) #. # must report 0 errors ## 3. SKILL.md conventions: frontmatter present, name matches directory, < 200 lines. #
```

If you touched either plugin manifest, also run Cursor's own validator against the repo root. It is not vendored here (and not part of CI) because the manifests are static; fetch it on demand:

```
# run from the repo root #
```

It should report `Validation passed`. The two warnings about a missing `hooks/hooks.json` and `mcp.json` are expected — this plugin ships neither.

**Keep mechanical formatting in its own commit.** When `--fix` reformats files, commit that reformat separately (e.g. `style: apply markdownlint auto-fixes`) from any content changes, so reviewers can read the substantive diff without noise.

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting a PR:

* SKILL.md is under 200 lines
* Playbooks follow the standard structure
* References are clear and comprehensive
* All internal links work (playbook → reference, etc.)
* No hardcoded secrets or credentials
* Markdown is clean and renders correctly
* Tested with at least one AI assistant
* README.md updated if adding new skill or major feature
* No agent-specific features (pure markdown only)

---

## Writing Style

### For Playbooks

* **Imperative mood**: "Create a project", not "You should create a project"
* **Concrete steps**: Actual commands, not vague instructions
* **Expected output**: Show what success looks like
* **Error handling**: What to do when things go wrong

**Good**:

```
1. ``` bash"my-project" " "
```

Expected output: `Project created: p-abc123`

1. If you see "Permission denied", verify your token has api\_write scope.

```
 **Bad**: ```markdown 1. You might want to create a project using the CLI. 2. If there's an error, try fixing it. 
```

### For References

* **Clear explanations**: Assume reader is learning
* **Examples**: Show, don't just tell
* **Links**: Reference official docs when appropriate
* **Context**: Why does this matter?

---

## Git Workflow

* `master` - stable, tested content
* `feature/` - new skills, playbooks, or references
* `fix/` - bug fixes, typo corrections

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

```
feat(migrate): add PostgreSQL migration playbook fix(zerodeploy): correct port configuration instructions docs: update README with new installation paths 
```

### Pull Requests

1. **Title**: Clear, concise description
2. **Description**: What does this PR do? Why?
3. **Testing**: How did you test this?
4. **Screenshots**: If relevant (especially for documentation changes)
5. **Checklist**: Did you complete the Code Review Checklist above?

---

Skills don't have explicit version numbers. Instead:

* **Git tags** for major milestones
* **Commit hashes** for pinning to specific versions
* **Latest master** is the default

Users who need stability can:

```
git clone --branch v1.0.0 https://github.com/mittwald/agent-skills.git
```

Or pin to a commit:

### Updating for API Changes

When mittwald API changes:

1. Update affected playbooks
2. Update references (especially `mittwald-surfaces.md`, `mittwald-mcp-tools.md`)
3. Test all workflows
4. Document breaking changes in commit message
5. Consider adding to pitfalls if it's a common trap

### Deprecating Content

When removing old playbooks or references:

1. Add deprecation notice at top of file
2. Point to replacement content
3. Keep the file for 6 months
4. Then remove in a clearly-marked PR

### Harvesting migration-learnings issues

At the end of a real migration, the `mittwald-migrate` skill offers the operator the chance to file a short, **sanitized** issue summarizing what happened (see the [`contribute-learnings`](/mittwald/agent-skills/blob/master/skills/mittwald-migrate/playbooks/contribute-learnings.md) playbook). These land on this repo with the `migration-learnings` label and are the raw material for growing the skill. Harvest them periodically:

1. List open issues labelled `migration-learnings`.
2. **Re-check sanitization first** — these are public; if one slipped in a secret or identifying detail, edit it down (or ask the author) before acting on it.
3. **Verify each claimed trap** against the current API / `mw` CLI / developer docs — they are operator-reported, not yet confirmed.
4. Turn each confirmed new trap into an appended entry in [`mittwald-migrate/references/pitfalls.md`](/mittwald/agent-skills/blob/master/skills/mittwald-migrate/references/pitfalls.md) and wire it into the relevant playbook step.
5. Turn runbook gaps ("step X was thin, wrong, or missing") into playbook edits.
6. Close the issue referencing the commit or PR that harvested it, so the trail stays traceable.

Worked example: [issue #10](https://github.com/mittwald/agent-skills/issues/10) (Shared Hosting → PHP Runtime App + MariaDB Container).

## Common Pitfalls (for Contributors)

1. **Making SKILL.md too long** - It should be an index, not a manual. Move content to playbooks/references.
2. **Hardcoding values** - Use placeholders like , , not real values.
3. **Agent-specific features** - Avoid anything that only works in one AI assistant.
4. **Assuming context** - Each playbook should be relatively self-contained. Link to prerequisites.
5. **Forgetting links** - Playbooks should link to relevant references. SKILL.md should link to everything.
6. **Inconsistent naming** - Follow the conventions: `action-noun.md` for playbooks, `noun.md` for references.

* **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bugs, feature requests, or questions
* **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general questions or ideas
* **Support**: For mittwald platform issues (not skill issues), use <https://studio.mittwald.de> support
